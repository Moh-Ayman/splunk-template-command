    """ Counts the number of non-overlapping matches to a regular expression in a set of fields.
    ##Syntax
    .. code-block::
        countmatches fieldname=<field> pattern=<regular_expression> <field-list>
    ##Description
    A count of the number of non-overlapping matches to the regular expression specified by `pattern` is computed for
    each record processed. The result is stored in the field specified by `fieldname`. If `fieldname` exists, its value
    is replaced. If `fieldname` does not exist, it is created. Event records are otherwise passed through to the next
    pipeline processor unmodified.
    ##Example
    Count the number of words in the `text` of each tweet in tweets.csv and store the result in `word_count`.
    .. code-block::
        | inputlookup tweets | countmatches fieldname=word_count pattern="\\w+" text
